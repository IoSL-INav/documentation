The well known Global Positioning System (GPS) works nice outdoors but indoors it gets much worse and not really precise. So GPS does not work well indoors. The goal of this project is to research possibilities for indoor navigation to find other participants indoors. We had to implement three parts to achieve our purpose. An iOS and Android application as well as an backend to handle the communication between our clients and persists the data. One main technology provided by the SNET department were the Estimote bluetooth tokens which were a very nice opportunity to operate and test the technology of a bluetooth low energy devices. To manage and authenticate users in our system we used an implementation of Keycloak which allows us to have a single-sign-on and good security solution for our project. The implementation is the CYCLONE Federation Provider which is developed by the SNET department. At the end we tested our project in the main canteen of the Technical University Berlin.
